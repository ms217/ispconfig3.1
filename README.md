# ISPConfig - Hosting Control Panel

ISPConfig 3.1 Repository  

Even if this ISPC 3.1 repository may provide a bit more security  
for the last ISPConfig 3.1.15p3 release with some additional minor bugfixes  
the UPGRADE to a maintained version of ISPConfig is very strongly RECOMMENDED!  

- Manage multiple servers from one control panel
- Web server management (Apache2 and nginx)
- Mail server management (with virtual mail users)
- DNS server management (BIND and MyDNS)
- Virtualization (OpenVZ)
- Administrator, reseller and client login
- Configuration mirroring and clusters
- Open Source software (BSD license)
