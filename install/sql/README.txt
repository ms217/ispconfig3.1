When you add or modify a database field or table in the ISPConfig database,
then follow these steps:

1) Add the field or table in the ispconfig3.sql file. This file contains the
   complete database dump which is used when ISPConfig gets installed.
   
2) Create a new file in the "incremental" subfolder wich contains the alter 
   table, or if it is a complete new table then the add table, statement(s) in 
   MySQL syntax which is/are required to modify the current ispconfig database 
   during update. The naming scheme of the sql patch update files is 
   upd_0001.sql, upd_0002.sql, upd_0003.sql etc. Ensure that the number that 
   you choose for the new file is a +1 increment of the number of the last
   existing file and that the number is formatted with 4 digits.
   
   A patch file may contain one or more alter table statements. Every patch file
   gets executed once in the database, so do not modify older (already released) 
   patch files, they will not get executed again if the update was already run 
   once on a system.
   
   After a patch has been executed, the dbversion field in the server table gets
   increeased to the version number of the last installed patch.
   
   If you like to run a patch file again for testing purposes on your dev machine,
   then set the number in "dbversion" field of the server table to be lower then
   the number of your patch.
   
Note: Incremental patches are supported for installed ISPConfig versions > 3.0.3.
      If the installed version is < 3.0.3, then the full update method is used.
	  In other words, ISPConfig 3.0.3 is the patch release (dbversion) 0 as the 
	  incremental update feature has been introduced in 3.0.3.
